# Juicer installation

This is an instruction of Juicer installation for CPU version, which can deal with Hi-C data.

## Create and conda environment for Juicer:

    conda create â€“name juicer
    conda activate juicer

## Download the Juicer and reference files:

    mkdir ~/opt/Juicer
    git clone https://github.com/theaidenlab/juicer.git
    cd ~/opt/Juicer
    ln -s ~/juicer/CPU scripts
    cd scripts/common
    wget https://hicfiles.tc4ga.com/public/juicer/juicer_tools.1.9.9_jcuda.0.8.jar
    ln -s juicer_tools.1.9.9_jcuda.0.8.jar  juicer_tools.jar
    cd ../..
	
### Blow is just an example for Juicer data format, please see the Juicer build below

    mkdir references
    cp <my_reference_fastas_and_indices> references/
	
    # this is optional, only needed for fragment-delimited files
	
    ln -s <myRestrictionSiteDir> restriction_sites
    cd <myWorkingDir>
    mkdir fastq
    mv <fastq_files> fastq/
    ~/opt/Juicer/scripts/juicer.sh -D <myJuicerDir>

## Installation the dependencies for Juicer:

1) GNU CoreUtils
    conda install -c conda-forge coreutils
2) Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)
    conda install -c bioconda bwa

## Build the Juicer using reference data

1) Make the reference folder
    mkdir juicer_data
    cd juicer_data
    mkdir references; cd references
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/references/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/references/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta.amb
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/references/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta.ann
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/references/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta.bwt
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/references/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta.pac
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/references/Homo_sapiens_assembly19.fasta.sa
    cd ..

2) Build the restriction site folder
    mkdir restriction_sites; cd restriction_sites
    wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/juicerawsmirror/opt/juicer/restriction_sites/hg19_MboI.txt
    awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"}{print $1, $NF}' hg19_MboI.txt > hg19.chrom.sizes
    cd ..

3) Build the dataset from Hi-C
    mkdir HIC003; cd HIC003
    mkdir fastq; cd fastq
    wget http://juicerawsmirror.s3.amazonaws.com/opt/juicer/work/HIC003/fastq/HIC003_S2_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
    wget http://juicerawsmirror.s3.amazonaws.com/opt/juicer/work/HIC003/fastq/HIC003_S2_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
    cd ..
